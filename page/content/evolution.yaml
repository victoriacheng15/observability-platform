intro_text: "From experimenting with local infrastructure to building a focused observability tool—driven by telemetry needs."
timeline:
  - date: "2025-11-20"
    title: "Built a Reliable Local Lab"
    description: |
      - Set up a Docker environment with core services: Jenkins, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, and more.
      - Automated volume management, backups, and service isolation with custom scripts.
      - Evaluated storage options—chose PostgreSQL for its flexibility over specialized time-series databases.
  - date: "2025-12-25"
    title: "Telemetry Engine Initialization"
    artifacts:
      - name: "RFC 001: Postgres vs InfluxDB"
        url: "docs/decisions/001-postgres-vs-influxdb.md"
    description: |
      - Built a lightweight Go proxy to emit structured telemetry: HTTP requests, errors, and health events.
      - Adopted PostgreSQL with JSONB to unify logs and metrics in a single, flexible schema, moving away from InfluxDB.
  - date: "2025-12-31"
    title: "Hybrid Cloud Architecture"
    artifacts:
      - name: "RFC 002: Cloud-to-Local Bridge"
        url: "docs/decisions/002-cloud-to-local-bridge.md"
    description: |
      - Designed a secure "Store-and-Forward" bridge to ingest telemetry from Azure Functions into the local private network.
      - Implemented a polling consumer in Go to bypass NAT restrictions without exposing ports or maintaining VPNs.
      - Decoupled stateless collectors from persistent storage to enable independent scaling.
  - date: "2026-01-01"
    title: "Project Portal Launch"
    description: |
      - Released the self-hosted visualization portal to track system evolution and technical constraints.
      - Implemented a unified dashboard for real-time system metrics and personal reading analytics.
  - date: "2026-01-03"
    title: "Standardization & Logging"
    artifacts:
      - name: "RFC 003: Shared Logging Library"
        url: "docs/decisions/003-shared-logging-library.md"
    description: |
      - Implemented a unified logging strategy using a shared 'pkg/logger' module to ensure consistent structured observability across all services.
      - Formalized a "Documentation as Code" standard, treating architectural decisions (RFCs) as first-class artifacts.
  - date: "2026-01-08"
    title: "Automated Insights & GitOps Strategy"
    artifacts:
      - name: "RFC 004: Spatial Telemetry keyboard"
        url: "docs/decisions/004-spatial-telemetry-keyboard.md"
      - name: "RFC 005: GitOps Reconciliation"
        url: "docs/decisions/005-gitops-reconciliation-engine.md"
    description: |
      - Automated reading analytics ingestion using systemd timers for reliable, journal-backed scheduling.
      - Validated GitOps strategy for automated repository synchronization and configuration management.
  - date: "2026-01-09"
    title: "Standardized Postgres Database Configuration"
    artifacts:
      - name: "RFC 006: Shared Database Connection"
        url: "docs/decisions/006-shared-database-module.md"
    description: |
      - Centralized database connection logic into a shared module (pkg/db) to ensure consistency.
      - Enforced standardized defaults (e.g., UTC timezone) for all service database interactions.
      - Refactored proxy and system-metrics to consume the shared database module.
  - date: "2026-01-10"
    title: "Phase 1: GitOps Infrastructure"
    artifacts:
      - name: "RFC 005: GitOps Reconciliation"
        url: "docs/decisions/005-gitops-reconciliation-engine.md"
    description: |
      - Implemented a secure GitOps reconciliation engine using templated Systemd units (@) to automate repository synchronization.
      - Adopted an "Allowlist" pattern for repository access control and "Logfmt" for native observability integration.
  - date: "2026-01-11"
    title: "Initial Systemd Log Ingestion via Promtail" 
    description: |
      - Established a pipeline to ingest systemd journal logs into Loki using Promtail, providing foundational observability for host-level services.
      - Implemented initial log parsing and labeling for key systemd units (gitops-sync, reading-sync, and system-metrics).
