      title: "Built a Reliable Local Lab"
      description: |
        - Set up a Docker environment with core services: Jenkins, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, and more.
        - Automated volume management, backups, and service isolation with custom scripts.
        - Evaluated storage options—chose PostgreSQL for its flexibility over specialized time-series databases.

      title: "Explored Grafana & Telemetry"
      rfc: "docs/decisions/001-postgres-vs-influxdb.md"
      description: |
        - Built a lightweight Go proxy to emit structured telemetry: HTTP requests, errors, and health events.
        - Adopted PostgreSQL with JSONB to unify logs and metrics in a single, flexible schema, moving away from InfluxDB.
    - date: "2025-12 (late)"
      title: "Hybrid Cloud Integration"
      rfc: "docs/decisions/002-cloud-to-local-bridge.md"
      description: |
        - Designed a secure "Store-and-Forward" bridge to ingest telemetry from Azure Functions into the local private network.
        - Implemented a polling consumer in Go to bypass NAT restrictions without exposing ports or maintaining VPNs.
        - Decoupled stateless collectors from persistent storage to enable independent scaling.
    - date: "2026-01"
      title: "Platform Maturity & Knowledge Engine"
      description: |
        - Formalized a "Documentation as Code" standard, treating architectural decisions (RFCs) as first-class artifacts.
        - Launched the project portal to visualize system evolution and technical constraints, reducing onboarding time for new contributors.
