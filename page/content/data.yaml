  events:
    - date: "2025-11"
      title: "Built a Reliable Local Lab"
      description: |
        - Set up a Docker environment with core services: Jenkins, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, and more.
        - Automated volume management, backups, and service isolation with custom scripts.
        - Evaluated storage options—chose PostgreSQL for its flexibility over specialized time-series databases.
    - date: "2025-12 (early)"
      title: "Explored Grafana & Telemetry"
      artifacts:
        - name: "RFC 001: Postgres vs InfluxDB"
          url: "docs/decisions/001-postgres-vs-influxdb.md"
      description: |
        - Built a lightweight Go proxy to emit structured telemetry: HTTP requests, errors, and health events.
        - Adopted PostgreSQL with JSONB to unify logs and metrics in a single, flexible schema, moving away from InfluxDB.
    - date: "2025-12 (late)"
      title: "Hybrid Cloud Integration"
      artifacts:
        - name: "RFC 002: Cloud-to-Local Bridge"
          url: "docs/decisions/002-cloud-to-local-bridge.md"
      description: |
        - Designed a secure "Store-and-Forward" bridge to ingest telemetry from Azure Functions into the local private network.
        - Implemented a polling consumer in Go to bypass NAT restrictions without exposing ports or maintaining VPNs.
        - Decoupled stateless collectors from persistent storage to enable independent scaling.

        - name: "RFC 005: GitOps Reconciliation"
          url: "docs/decisions/005-gitops-reconciliation-engine.md"
      description: |
        - Launched the project portal to visualize system evolution and technical constraints.
        - Formalized a "Documentation as Code" standard, treating architectural decisions (RFCs) as first-class artifacts.
        - Implemented a unified logging strategy using a shared 'pkg/logger' module to ensure consistent structured observability across all services.
        - Automated reading analytics ingestion and system metrics collection using systemd timers for reliable, journal-backed scheduling.
