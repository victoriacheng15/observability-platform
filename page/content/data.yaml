  events:
    - date: "2025-11-20"
      title: "Built a Reliable Local Lab"
      description: |
        - Set up a Docker environment with core services: Jenkins, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, and more.
        - Automated volume management, backups, and service isolation with custom scripts.
        - Evaluated storage options—chose PostgreSQL for its flexibility over specialized time-series databases.
    - date: "2025-12-25"
      title: "Telemetry Engine Initialization"
      artifacts:
        - name: "RFC 001: Postgres vs InfluxDB"
          url: "docs/decisions/001-postgres-vs-influxdb.md"
      description: |
        - Built a lightweight Go proxy to emit structured telemetry: HTTP requests, errors, and health events.
        - Adopted PostgreSQL with JSONB to unify logs and metrics in a single, flexible schema, moving away from InfluxDB.
    - date: "2025-12-31"
      title: "Hybrid Cloud Architecture"
      artifacts:
        - name: "RFC 002: Cloud-to-Local Bridge"
          url: "docs/decisions/002-cloud-to-local-bridge.md"
      description: |
        - Designed a secure "Store-and-Forward" bridge to ingest telemetry from Azure Functions into the local private network.
        - Implemented a polling consumer in Go to bypass NAT restrictions without exposing ports or maintaining VPNs.
        - Decoupled stateless collectors from persistent storage to enable independent scaling.
    - date: "2026-01-01"
      title: "Project Portal Launch"
      description: |
        - Released the self-hosted visualization portal to track system evolution and technical constraints.
        - Implemented a unified dashboard for real-time system metrics and personal reading analytics.
    - date: "2026-01-03"
      title: "Standardization & Logging"
      artifacts:
        - name: "RFC 003: Shared Logging Library"
          url: "docs/decisions/003-shared-logging-library.md"
      description: |
        - Implemented a unified logging strategy using a shared 'pkg/logger' module to ensure consistent structured observability across all services.
        - Formalized a "Documentation as Code" standard, treating architectural decisions (RFCs) as first-class artifacts.
    - date: "2026-01-08"
      title: "Automated Insights & GitOps Strategy"
      artifacts:
        - name: "RFC 004: Spatial Telemetry keyboard"

        - name: "RFC 005: GitOps Reconciliation"
          url: "docs/decisions/005-gitops-reconciliation-engine.md"
      description: |
        - Automated reading analytics ingestion using systemd timers for reliable, journal-backed scheduling.
        - Validated GitOps strategy for automated repository synchronization and configuration management.
    - date: "2026-01-09"
      title: "Standardized Postgres Database Configuration"
      artifacts:
        - name: "RFC 006: Shared Database Connection"
          url: "docs/decisions/006-shared-database-module.md"
      description: |
        - Centralized database connection logic into a shared module (pkg/db) to ensure consistency.
        - Enforced standardized defaults (e.g., UTC timezone) for all service database interactions.
        - Refactored proxy and system-metrics to consume the shared database module.
