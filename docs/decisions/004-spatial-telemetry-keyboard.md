# RFC 004: Spatial Keyboard Telemetry Pipeline

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2026-01-03
**Author:** Victoria Cheng

## The Problem

Standard input monitoring (keyloggers or counters) lacks the physical context of *where* interactions happen. For ergonomic analysis, heatmapping, and advanced hardware telemetry, we need a way to map raw Linux input events to physical coordinates on a 2D plane.

Existing solutions are either platform-specific (Windows-only), high-latency (Python-based), or closed-source. We need a low-level, high-performance bridge that can ship this data from an "Edge" device (Desktop) to a "Control Plane" (Laptop) without impacting system performance.

## Proposed Solution

A distributed IoT pipeline consisting of three tiers:

- **C++ Edge Agent:** Reads `/dev/input/event*` directly using `ioctl`. Maps scancodes to `(x, y)` coordinates in millimeters.
- **Go Proxy (Gateway):** A centralized ingress point that validates telemetry payloads and batches them for database insertion.
- **PostGIS (Storage):** A relational database with spatial indexing to store keypresses as `GEOMETRY(POINT)`.

### Rationale

- **C++ for Performance:** Direct kernel access and zero Garbage Collection (GC) ensures that even high-speed typing (150+ WPM) doesn't cause telemetry lag or CPU spikes.
- **Distributed Architecture:** Decouples the data collection (Desktop) from the visualization (Laptop), allowing the observability hub to remain centralized.
- **Spatial Focus:** By using PostGIS, we can perform advanced spatial queries (e.g., "distance traveled between keypresses") that are impossible in standard time-series databases.

## Comparison / Alternatives Considered

| Feature | Python / Node Script | C++ Agent (Proposed) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Resource Usage** | Moderate CPU / High RAM | Near-zero CPU / < 5MB RAM |
| **Kernel Interface** | Wrapper libraries (Heavy) | Direct `ioctl` (Native) |
| **Latentcy** | GC Pauses possible | Deterministic |
| **Portability** | Requires Runtime (interpreter) | Static Binary |

## Failure Modes (Operational Excellence)

| Scenario | Impact | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Network Loss** | Data cannot be shipped. | Agent implements an in-memory ring buffer (10k events) using FIFO. |
| **High Load** | DB pressure. | Go Proxy uses worker pools and batch inserts. |
| **Device Swap** | Scancodes change. | Configuration-driven mapping via `layout.json`. |

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a high-signal portfolio piece that demonstrates full-stack systems engineering—from hardware-level C++ to cloud-native Go and advanced SQL.
